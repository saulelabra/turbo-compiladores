                                 Deterministic Finite Automaton (AFD)    
                ______________________________________________________________________

Write a program that reads from a file the elements that define a AFD and indicate if the input
string is accepted by the automaton.

The file is defined as follows:
  ● The first row indicates the set of states separated by commas.
  ● The second row indicates the alphabet symbols separated by commas.
  ● The third row indicates the initial state.
  ● The fourth row indicates the initial state.
  ● The next rows after the fourth one indicate the evaluation of the transition function in the
  
following format:
  initialSymbol, nextSymbol: state
  Example:
    q0,a:q0
    Indicates that the automaton process: δ(q0,a) = {q0}
      
The final output of the program has to print out the resulting transitions and if the string
was accepted or not.
Note: Assume that the values of the input file are correct and they do not need to be validated
